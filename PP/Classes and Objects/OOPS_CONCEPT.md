1) **Classes and Objects**
        A class is a user defined data type which can be defined in datastructure as class.
        Object is a instance of a class.

        Syntax: 
            class student{
            Members (Data members, Data Functions)
            float M1,M2,M3,Total,Rest;
            int calResult ();
            };
            int main(){
            s1.calResult;
            return 0;
            }

        Access Specifiers:
            a) Public 
            b) Private -- Default
            c) Protected


2) **Data Abstraction** 
        To access variables outside the defined set.


3) **Inheritance**
        To inerit data from parent class to child class.


4) **Polymorphism**
        It allows C++ code to follow more than one form or meaning of soem variable or symbol.
        Function Overriding.
